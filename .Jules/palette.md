## 2026-01-15 - Standalone Apps in Public
**Learning:** Standalone HTML applications located in `public/` (like the playground) bypass the built-in accessibility features of the VitePress theme. They often rely on vanilla JS/CSS and require manual implementation of ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.
**Action:** Always check `public/` for hidden "mini-apps" and verify their accessibility independently of the main documentation site.
